Play on itch (web + windows)

# Game Instructions
Your goal is to get $5000000 
Play cards to tend to your blobs 
Play cards to sell your blobs 
Bigger blobs eat more food, but sell for a lot more! 
Advance time to draw more cards, but also make blobs hunger 
At night improve your deck with money 
You cannot lose, but you can soft-lock yourself if you remove all your critical cards like `sell` or `manifest` 
Upgrade shop to unlock better cards, but also things get more expensive 
Alternatively play like an idle game: Only click "advance time" every 5 minutes! :D
